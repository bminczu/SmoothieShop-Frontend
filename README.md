Bali Bowls is a single page JavaScript application intended to serve as a user interface for ordering smoothie style fruit bowls from a smartphone, computer or touchscreen kiosk.

Users are guided through the ordering process beginning with providing a name for the order. Users then have the option to choose from various size options after which they can choose to either pick a shop favorite pre made item or create their own by clicking the various topping icons which will then be added to their order. Once the order is complete all that is left to do is enjoy!

To Start:

Make sure you are CD'd into the correct repo (backend and frontend)
